gRPC
====

Although for my implementation I chose to use a lot gRPC services, only one is *externally exposed* to the public: Location Service.

This will allow an external client, e.g. a mobile application, to create Locations in efficient way.

I created a simple Python script, loaded in this folder (location_tester.py) that can be used to test
the Location creation (the service is listening on port 30005).

Usage:

python location_tester.py
